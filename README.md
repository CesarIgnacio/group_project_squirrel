SQUIRRELRESEARCH

The following is our research on the squirrels that reside in Central Park. We used the data given to us to display their various findings about the squirrels.

We got our information using NYC's Squirrel Data of Central Park, and used it to conclude the location of the majority of the squirrels throughout the park, how diverse and common the colors are, the ratio of the plain squirrels to the colored, their reactions, and their respective age groups, which we turned into percentages. 

While we did face multiple problems trying to create this project, we managed to find a way around them, generally through means such as trial and error or by having a different perspective check out our respective code.
